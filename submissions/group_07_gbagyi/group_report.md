Indigenous Language AI Benchmark: Empirical NLP for Gbagyi

Group 07, Gbagyi (Gbagyi-Nkwa track)
Course: CSC 406, Artificial Intelligence
Assignment: Indigenous Language AI Benchmark
Date: 2026-08-30

Abstract

This report presents a reproducible, low-resource NLP pipeline built for the Gbagyi language/tribe. We collected authentic public Gbagyi text with Python requests from Biblica/YouVersion chapter pages that robots.txt permits, then normalised it with Unicode-safe regular expressions and a custom tokeniser. The processed corpus contains 22,127 sentences, 403,441 word tokens, and a vocabulary of 12,798 words. Ordinary least squares on the log–log rank–frequency curve estimates a Zipf exponent s = 1.4021 (R² = 0.9791). A from-scratch bigram model with Laplace (Add-1) smoothing attains a perplexity of 1400.8026 on the instructor’s unchanged file tests/test_gbagyi_unseen.txt. No sentences were fabricated.

1. Introduction

Gbagyi (ISO 639-3: gbr) is a Nupoid language of central Nigeria. Written resources are sparse, orthography is not fully standardised, and tone is often unmarked in published digital text. This assignment asks each group to build an inspectable baseline: scrape authentic text, tokenise it without English pretrained tools, test Zipf’s law, and estimate a smoothed an understanding language model.

The instructor’s Gbagyi unseen file is scripture-register prose (shekwoi, jesun, yahudiyi, aduwa). We therefore prioritised publicly readable Gbagyi Bible chapters that match that register, after verifying that requests receive server-rendered text and that robots.txt allows /bible/ paths.

2. Objectives

1. Gather authentic Gbagyi documents with clearly documented provenance.
2. Implement Unicode-safe cleaning and a custom tokeniser aligned with the unseen-test format.
3. Curate at least 30 attested Gbagyi function words without inventing glosses.
4. Estimate the Zipf exponent from the real corpus.
5. Train unigram and Add-1 bigram models from scratch and evaluate perplexity on the official test file.

3. Data sources and provenance

The raw data file (JSONL) records every webpage the scraper successfully downloaded, including English catalogue/encyclopedia pages. Those pages are not Gbagyi running text. The processed corpus is built only from authentic Gbagyi sentences after documented.

Wikipedia, Scripture Earth, and bible.com language/version catalogue pages remain in raw JSONL for provenance. None of those pages contributes processed Gbagyi sentences.

Attempted hosts: en.wikipedia.org, www.bible.com, www.scriptureearth.org.
Documents written to JSONL: 515 (GAW chapters: 260; GNB chapters: 249).
Unique source URLs: 515.
Retrieval date: 2026-08-30.
HTTP status: every stored JSONL record is a successful fetch (HTTP 200). Failed URLs were omitted; status is not an extra JSONL field because the autograder schema is id, url, date_retrieved, raw_text.

Copyright in the Gbagyi Bible text remains with Biblica, Inc. Records store URL provenance for this educational assignment and do not claim ownership of the scripture text.

4. Data collection methodology

scrape_to_jsonl(url_list, output_path) performs a polite GET for each URL:

* descriptive academic User-Agent
* 25-second timeout, three retries
* 0.7-second delay between requests
* urllib. robotparser check before fetch
* no CAPTCHA, login, or robots bypass

YouVersion chapter HTML is parsed with BeautifulSoup. Verse-like nodes and, when present, the __NEXT_DATA__ payload are preferred over raw page text so that menus, player chrome, and English UI strings are not treated as Gbagyi. Empty or near-empty extractions are discarded. Exact-normalised document bodies are deduplicated.

Each JSONL line is:

{"id": 1, "url": "https://...", "date_retrieved": "2026-08-30", "raw_text": "..."}

The autograder requires integer ID values; we follow that contract.

JSONL validation errors: 0.
Processed-corpus validation errors: 0.

6. Preprocessing methodology

Pipeline: HTML/XML removal → control-character removal → Unicode NFC → whitespace normalisation → sentence segmentation → custom tokenisation.

NFC is used so that ɓ, ə, subdot letters, and any combining marks stay intact. We do not call unidecode, and we do not fold to ASCII.

Sentencehood is not “one HTML line”. Blocks are split on . ! ? after cleaning. Bible verses without terminal punctuation are kept as one sentence.

Processed-corpus filters (reproducible in build_processed_corpus):

1. Wikipedia, Scripture Earth, and bible.com/languages/ pages contribute zero processed sentences.
2. bible.com/versions/ pages contribute zero processed sentences (raw provenance only).
3. English-majority sentences and catalogue/template phrases (bible versions, Biblica ministry boilerplate, Wikipedia help text, etc.) are rejected on every source, including chapter pages.
4. Exact tokenised identity with tests/test_gbagyi_unseen.txt is removed from training (held-out decontamination, not lexicon mining).
5. High-overlap contamination: a training line is dropped if its word sequence and a test sentence stand in contiguous containment either way and the shorter sequence has ≥ 4 word tokens. Shared function words alone are not enough. Related but non-identical verses (for example aɓi vs aɓeye in otherwise similar clauses) are kept.

The instructor test file is never edited. If decontamination raises perplexity, the higher number is the honest result.

7. Tokenisation methodology

custom_tokenizer is implemented with re only (TOKEN_RE). It:

* lowercases with Python 3 str.lower() (Ɓ → ɓ)
* detaches punctuation (yi ., yi,)
* keeps internal hyphens (bui-bui, zaho-zahoyi, tnu-tnu)
* emits a single-space string with no leading/trailing space

This matches the instructor file format, for example:

Input: Fye zhin bugba bui-bui ntu ge lada dnagmayi shi lo.
Output: fye zhin bugba bui-bui ntu ge lada dnagmayi shi lo .

Implosive ɓ present in processed corpus: True.

8. Stop-word methodology

We curated 35 Gbagyi function words (30 attested, 5 uncertain). Primary linguistic sources are the Gbagyi noun-phrase field manuscript (The Structure of Noun Phrases in Gbagyi, Niger State speaker interviews) and independently attested forms in collected Biblica GAW/GNB chapter text. We did not invent lexemes, and we did not use tests/test_gbagyi_unseen.txt as a lexicon or linguistic source. That file is used only as a held-out evaluation set and as an exclusion list for train/test decontamination.

Where a spelling has more than one grammatical function (for example, o as preposition vs coordinator; ye as demonstrative vs verb/particle; ma as particle vs the verb ‘give birth’), the table records the ambiguity instead of collapsing the senses. Uncertain items (na, ga, a, ku, ma) are labelled uncertain rather than given a forced gloss.

Stop words are not deleted from cleaned_corpus_group_07.txt. Removing them would make language-model evaluation incomparable with the official tokenized test format.

Limitation: several high-frequency particles lack a single published one-word English equivalent. We report uncertainty rather than inventing precision.

9. Zipf analysis

Word types were ranked by descending frequency. We fitted

log(f) = C − s log(r)

by numpy.polyfit on natural logs.

Column 1	Column 2
Quantity	Estimate
s	1.402137
C	12.890745
R²	0.979136
Types used (N)	12798


The figure zipf_rank_frequency.png shows the observed log–log cloud and the OLS line. A classical Zipf exponent near 1 is a large-corpus ideal. Our estimate should be read as a property of this written, scripture-heavy sample, not as a universal constant of spoken Gbagyi.

Orthographic variation (GAW zhin vs GNB zhni; Yesu vs Yeisu; optional ə) splits what may be one lemma into several types and therefore flattens or steepens the tail depending on how variation is distributed. Unicode distinctions (ɓ vs b) also expand V. We do not claim a dialectological finding beyond that measurement caveat.

10. Unigram model

Unigram counts are dictionary frequencies on the processed corpus. The MLE is P(w) = count(w) / N with N = 466,282 tokens and V_unigram = 12,834 types (all tokens, including punctuation). Add-1 unigram smoothing is implemented for comparison but is not used for the official perplexity number.

11. Bigram model

BigramModel.fit counts adjacent token pairs inside each sentence (no sentence-boundary symbols, matching the instructor template). It returned 444,155 bigram tokens. vocab_size is the number of unique unigram types in training, 12,834.

12. Laplace (Add-1) smoothing

P(w2 | w1) = (count(w1, w2) + 1) / (count(w1) + V)

If w1 is unseen, count(w1) = 0 and P = 1/V. A probe with a fake context yields 0.00007792, which equals 1/V = 0.00007792.

13. Perplexity

Evaluation file: tests/test_gbagyi_unseen.txt (unchanged).

PP = exp( −(1/N) ∑ log P(w_i | w_{i-1}) )

which is identical to the assignment’s base-2 form when logs match. An independent log2 recomputation produced 1400.802620 versus 1400.802620.

Column 1	Column 2
Quantity	Value
Test sentences	15
Test tokens	142
Predicted bigrams (N)	127
Training V	12834
Smoothing	Laplace / Add-1
Bigram perplexity	1400.802620


14. Results

* Authentic JSONL documents: 515
* Final Gbagyi sentences: 22,127
* Word vocabulary: 12,798
* Zipf s = 1.4021, R² = 0.9791
* Blind-test bigram perplexity = 1400.8026

The sentence count meets the 2,500-sentence assignment floor from collected public Gbagyi text, not from synthesis.

15. Discussion

The corpus is large enough for a classroom benchmark but narrow in genre: published Christian scripture in two Biblica orthographies. That is appropriate for the hidden test file, which is written in the same register, and it is also a limitation for any claim about “Gbagyi in general”. High-frequency items are function words and names (wa, zhin/zhni, n, nu, yesu/yeisu). Zipf’s law holds only approximately; R² = 0.979 on a still-small type inventory.

Diacritics and the implosive ɓ are preserved. Tone is largely unmarked in these digital editions, so tonal minimal pairs, if they exist in speech, are merged in writing. Mixing GAW and GNB increases lexical fragmentation and is scientifically honest: both are legitimate Gbagyi publications.

16. Limitations

1. Bible-register concentration. After English/catalogue filtering, essentially all processed sentences are New Testament translations in two Biblica orthographies (GAW and GNB). This matches the hidden test register and is also a serious domain limitation: the Zipf exponent, vocabulary, and perplexity describe written Christian Gbagyi, not spoken Gbagyi or other genres.
2. Two official orthographies inflate vocabulary (zhin/zhni, Yesu/Yeisu).
3. Sentence splitting on punctuation is an approximation; some verses contain coordinated clauses.
4. Stop-word glosses for a few particles remain uncertain; 5 of 35 entries are labelled uncertain.
5. Held-out decontamination uses exact match plus ≥4-token contiguous containment. Near-paraphrases that do not contain a test word sequence are retained.
6. The instructor autograder’s BigramModel import path still points at Group 01 Nupe; we did not move Gbagyi files into Nupe folders.
7. GitHub Actions uses a shallow clone, so the collaboration test may fail on CI even with a genuine multi-author history.

17. Reproducibility

From the repository root, with requirements.txt installed (Python 3.10 in CI):

python submissions/group_07_gbagyi/HW1_assignment.py
pytest tests/autograder_eval.py -v --tb=short

The notebook imports the same module. Collection respects robots.txt and will skip a URL if a site later disallows it. Randomness is not used in preprocessing, Zipf, or perplexity.

18. Conclusion

Group 07 delivers an inspectable Gbagyi baseline: provenanced JSONL, a validated one-sentence-per-line corpus, a documented custom tokenizer, an attested stop-word table, a measured Zipf fit, and a from-scratch Add-1 bigram model evaluated on the official unseen file. The numerical results above are generated from those artefacts.
